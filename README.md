# dummy-2d-Sagitarius-A-simulation
A stupid python script to plot 2D simulation of Sagitarius A* Black Hole. I need more knowledges about mathematics compute to get a better and more realistic render. I will maybe translate it in CPP or C code with a complete graphic library.
 # TODO
- Add particles plots and real compute (photons)
- Write a real algorithm to get a realistic geomagneto perturbation render
- Add stars movements hypoteticals
- improves computes and algorithms

# usage 
-install python 3.10, pip3, matplotlib, scipy, math

python3.10 ./blackhole.py

(sorry for your CPU)
